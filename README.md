This is software for my automatic tracking telescope. I am modifying a Celestron C8-N newtonian reflector and Celestron Cg5 mount from manual to a GOTO mount.

This project is intended to be submitted to the computer science AQA 2026 NEA.

Most of the algorithms in this code have come from Practical astronomy with your calculator by Peter Duffett Smith (Ver 3)

To protect my security of passwords, private variables are stored in a .env file which has been ommited from this repository. You will need this for the project to function.
